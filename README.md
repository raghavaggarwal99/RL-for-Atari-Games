# RL-for-Atari-Games
RL implemented on Cartpole Problem 

This is a standard code for the cartpole problem that trains itself to get the maximum score possible. We use Deep RL here to fit the model in neural network to get the best output.
You can read the theory on Open AI gym library on its Documentation Page and basics of RL as mainly that we use is its Q-Values Dynamic Progarmming function.

You can see the score is very less.

After a little while you can output the average score by dividing the sum by no. of Runs
